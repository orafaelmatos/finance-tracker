# Personal Finance Tracker

A simple **command-line finance tracker** written in **C**, designed to help users log their incomes and expenses, view their transaction history, and check their financial summary.

- **Structs & Enums** for data modeling  
- **File I/O** for saving and loading data  
- **Loops & Switch statements** for menu-driven programs  
- **Basic validation** for user inputs

- Automatically **saves transactions** to a text file and reloads on startup
